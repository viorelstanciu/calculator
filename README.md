# calculator

Created a basic calculator, having the ability to perform operations. 
There is also the C (Clear) button that is going to reset back to 0 whenever it is being pressed.
After entering a long number it is going to display a scrollbar so that you can notice how long the number gets.
Decimals are implemented and work perfectly.

As you proably noticed, the calculator is mobile responsive.
